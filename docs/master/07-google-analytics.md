# Google analytics
Dimer let you setup Google Analytics on your website to measure the traffic and know more about your users.

Update the config file `(dimer.json)` by adding your tracking id under the themeSettings option.

```json
{
  "themeSettings": {
    "gaId": "UA-XXXXX-Y"
  }
}
```

Google analytics tracking id is available just above the embed code and usually starts with `UA-`. Check the following screenshot for reference.
